# Adjustable_TicTactoe
This is a terminal based tic tac toe game compiled using gcc and written in CodeBlocks IDE.

The "Adjustable" title for the game is because this tic tac toe implementation allows for the user to select any NxN board size with accurate winner checking for a game board of varying sizes while using a single dimension vector<string> for an algorithmic challenge.
